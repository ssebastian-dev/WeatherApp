# WeatherApp
Demo weather app

Setup:
  1. In order for the app to work we need an apy key:
  
  Sign up at OpenWeatherMap
  
  Navigate to API Keys section
  
  Copy your free API key
  
  Store your API key securely in local.properties - using the following key: OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=keyvalue (replace keyvalue with actual api key)
  
  2.Build and run the app

If I had more time I'd probably tweak the UI elements styling more, create a light/dark theme find some lottie animations that fits the purpose of the weather icons and create a mapper for those
animations in order to display them in the UI. And maybe adapt the logic in order to make use of a DI library and take into account seprated modules for a better speration of concern if other
features were to be added.
